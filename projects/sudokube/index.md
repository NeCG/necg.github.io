This was an internal project made by Tiago Fernandes and Marco Silva, as a way to apply the technology developed at NeCG in a full creative manner!  
The idea is now suffering further development with commercial intents, as so we are not disclosing all the material (code, tools, art, design) produced at that time.

Pay attention to the news section as we will reveal some information in the right time :)
