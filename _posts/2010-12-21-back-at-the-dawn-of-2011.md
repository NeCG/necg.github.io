That's right dear readers, coders, artists and dreamers! The Computer Graphics Student Group of FEUP is back online in the year that our University (University of Porto) [celebrates its centenary](http://centenario.up.pt/index.php).

We have new ideas and a very well defined path of activity to these early months of 2011.  
In the next weeks we will unveil our first project! Keep an eye on our website because we are totally sure that you'll be interested in what we are going to share here.

For now, we invite you to take a look at our new website!
