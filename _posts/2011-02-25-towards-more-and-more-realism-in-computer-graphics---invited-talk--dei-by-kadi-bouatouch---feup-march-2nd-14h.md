Realism is obtained with realistic modeling techniques (for geometry and physical parameters such BRDF, BSSRDF and scattering coefficients), rendering and global illumination algorithms.

Regarding modelling, we will show how to easily model a city using FL-systems (extension to L-systems) as well as grass fields and a human eye. Moreover, we will demonstrate that one can reconstruct a model from one image. As for global illumination, we will present some algorithms as well an analytical model dedicated to tree lighting (from the sky, the ground, the sun, and from other leaves).
