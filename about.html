    <p>The <strong>Computer Graphics Student Group of FEUP</strong>, NeCG|FEUP, was created back in 2006 by a group of undergraduate Informatics and Computing Engineering students who were passionate about Computer Graphics. After a few years of inactivity, we (the newcomers of 2013) are now aiming efforts to revive the group in a new format featuring three related areas: Computer Graphics, Interaction and Game Development.</p>
    <p>People from all kinds of backgrounds are welcome here: from the simple enthusiast to the computer graphics programmer, from the design specialist to the game experience analyst. We want to give people a chance to work here on what they really like to do.</p>
    <p>Without our teaching mentors none of this would be possible, and since our creation we have been strongly supported by the <a href="http://www.fe.up.pt/si_uk/unidades_geral.visualizar?p_unidade=151" target="_blank">Department of Informatics Engineering</a> (DEI) of the <a href="http://www.fe.up.pt/si_uk/web_page.inicial">Engineering Faculty of Porto University</a> (FEUP).</p>
